/**
 * Main Crafter content access API. Besides providing an interface to a content store or repository, implementations
 * of this service also should provide the following facilities:
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <b>Merging:</b>By using a certain merge strategy, the service is able to merge a collection of XML
 * descriptor documents into a single XML document for an item.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <b>Processing:</b>The service passes an item through one or multiple "processors" that can manipulate
 * and change the item as they need. For example, there is a processor implementation that includes other
 * descriptor documents into the item's descriptor document (see {@link org.craftercms.core.processors
 * .impl.IncludeDescriptorsProcessor}, an another one that processes element text of descriptor documents as
 * templates (see {@link org.craftercms.core.processors.impl.template.TemplateProcessor}).
 * </li>
 * </ul>
